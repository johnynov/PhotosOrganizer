# PhotosOranizer
This is a script helpful while importing your files from a sdcard back from trip, helpful with organising your desktop or any other folder.

This a script that allows you to organize your .jpg and .png files in folders by year and by month.
Script can be run from every place in the system - you just have to pass directory where you want to orgaznie files.

You can also organize files besides .jpg and .png extensions. Script will ask you:
> \>Do you want to organize only photos - /jpg and .png files [y/n]?

If choosen [n] every other file, besides folders will be oranized.

Script works on both Windows and Linux system. Enjoy :)
